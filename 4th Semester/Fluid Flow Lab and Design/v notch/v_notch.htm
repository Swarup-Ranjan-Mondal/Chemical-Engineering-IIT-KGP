</p><p>A weir is a notch of regular form through which water flows. The
term is also applied to the structure containing such a notch. Thus a
weir may be a depression in the side of a tank, reservoir, or channel,
or it may be an ovrflow dam or other similar structure. Weirs are
classified in accordance with the shape of the notch; there are
rectangular weirs; triangular, or <b>V-notch</b>, weirs; trapezoidal
weirs; and parabolic weirs. The edge or surface over which the water
flows is called the crest of the weir. The overflowing sheet of water
is termed the nappe. A broad-crested weir may be defined as one having
a horizontal or nearly horizontal crest sufficiently long in the
direction of flow so that the nappe will be supported.
